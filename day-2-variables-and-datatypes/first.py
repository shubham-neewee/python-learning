# Variable is a container where we store the values
a = 1
b = 2


# Printing the integer value
print("The integer value is : ",a)  # Output: 1
print("The integer value is : ",b)  # Output: 2

#Printing the addition of a and b taking the values as variable
print("The Sum of the variables is : ",a+b)



# Printing the name using the variable concept -- this is a string variable

none_value = None
print("The None value is : ",none_value)
